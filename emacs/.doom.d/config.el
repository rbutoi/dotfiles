Interactively, prompt for COMMAND with the current buffer's file
name supplied. When called from Dired, supply the name of the
file at point.

Like `async-shell-command`, but run in a vterm for full terminal features.

The new vterm buffer is named in the form `*foo bar.baz*`, the
command and its arguments in earmuffs.

When the command terminates, the shell remains open, but when the
shell exits, the buffer is killed."
